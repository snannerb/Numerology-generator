Create a web app that generates a random number from 0 to 999. Each number generated will show the descriptive meaning of the number generated. Give 30% higher odds generated to numbers "111" "222" "333" "444" "555" "666" "777" "888" "999". Give 20% higher odds generated to numbers "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9".  Use pixel font.

## Project Plan

### **Project Plan: Random Number Generator Web App**

#### **Objective:**
Create a simple web app that generates a random number between **0 and 999**, displays its descriptive meaning, and assigns higher odds to specific numbers.

---

### **Tasks:**

1. **Project Setup**:
   - [ ] Create a project folder with three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

2. **HTML Structure**:
   - [ ] Build a basic HTML structure with:
     - A title (`Random Number Generator`).
     - A **Generate Number** button.
     - A display area for the number and its meaning.

3. **Styling (CSS)**:
   - [ ] Set the background color to **grey**.
   - [ ] Use a **pixel font** (e.g., `Press Start 2P` from Google Fonts).
   - [ ] Style the button and result display for a clean, retro look.

4. **Random Number Logic (JavaScript)**:
   - [ ] Implement a random number generator that:
     - Generates numbers between **0 and 999**.
     - Assigns **30% higher odds** to numbers: `111`, `222`, `333`, `444`, `555`, `666`, `777`, `888`, `999`.
     - Assigns **20% higher odds** to numbers: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`.
   - [ ] Map each number to a descriptive meaning using an object or array.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - [ ] Add a click event listener to the **Generate Number** button.
   - [ ] Update the display area with the generated number and its meaning.

6. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Verify the weighted random number generator works as expected.
   - [ ] Test the app in multiple browsers for cross-browser compatibility.

7. **Deployment**:
   - [ ] Host the app on a free web hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).

### **Technical Considerations:**

1. **HTML**:
   - Use semantic elements (e.g., `button`, `div`) for accessibility.
   - Include a `<link>` tag to load the pixel font and CSS.

2. **CSS**:
   - Use `font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;` for the pixel font.
   - Center all text and ensure the button and result display are visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Use an array-based weighted random number generator for simplicity.
   - Store the descriptive meanings in an object for easy lookup.
   - Dynamically update the DOM using `textContent`.

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the app works in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

5. **Performance**:
   - Optimize the random number generator for efficiency.
   - Minimize DOM updates to reduce rendering time.
